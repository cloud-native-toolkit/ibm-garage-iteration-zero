# Cloud-Native Toolkit SRE Tools

This tile provisions a cluster in the IBM Cloud account using Classic infrastructure. It supports provisioning either an IKS 
or ROKS 3.11, 4.3, 4.4, or 4.5 clusters.

## Cloud-Native Toolkit

You can find out more information about the Cloud-Native Toolkit and the Iteration Zero terraform here:
    
- [IBM Garage Cloud Native Toolkit](https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/)
- [Toolkit Iteration Zero Terraform](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/ibm-garage-iteration-zero)

This tile is a piece of a larger Cloud-Native Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC) to enable end-to-end development and management of Cloud-Native applications

## Prerequisites

### Resource group

An existing resource group is needed to identify the collection of resources. It is **highly** recommended not to use the `default` resource group.
Instructions for creating a resource group can be found at [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-rgs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-rgs)

### IBM Cloud API key

An IBM Cloud API key for a user with sufficient authority to provision the SRE tool services into the resource group. API keys are
specific to an account, so a new API key will be needed for each account. Instructions for creating an API key can be 
found at [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key)

### Public and private vlans

Virtual local area networks (VLANs) are used by IBM CloudÂ® to isolate broadcast traffic on the public and private 
networks. Public and private vlans are needed to provision a cluster with classic infrastructure. Instructions for creating
a vlan can be found at [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-manage-classic-vlans#sl_vlan_create](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-manage-classic-vlans#sl_vlan_create)
