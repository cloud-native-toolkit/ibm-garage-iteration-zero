# Cloud-Native Toolkit SRE Tools

This tile installs a set of SRE Tools into a resource group in an IBM Cloud account. Typically, These tools will be
shared across different clusters and teams. This tile can be used to install those tools once on a central resource group
or multiple times into different resource groups, depending upon how the tools will be shared.

Additionally, the tile allows a selection of which individual tools to provision through the installation options. All of the tools
except for Activity Tracker have been configured to provision by default. Activity Tracker does not install by default because there are
limits on how many instances can be provisioned in the account.

## Prerequisites

### Resource group

An existing resource group is needed to identify the collection of resources. It is **highly** recommended not to use the `default` resource group.
Instructions for creating a resource group can be found at [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-rgs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-rgs)

### IBM Cloud API key

An IBM Cloud API key for a user with sufficient authority to provision the SRE tool services into the resource group. API keys are
specific to an account, so a new API key will be needed for each account. Instructions for creating an API key can be 
found at [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key)
