# Cloud-Native Toolkit

This tile provisions installs the Cloud-Native Toolkit DevSecOps tools into an existing cluster and optionally connects
the cluster to existing instances of LogDNA and Sysdig.

## Cloud-Native Toolkit

You can find out more information about the Cloud-Native Toolkit and the Iteration Zero terraform here:
    
- [IBM Garage Cloud Native Toolkit](https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/)
- [Toolkit Iteration Zero Terraform](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/ibm-garage-iteration-zero)

This tile is a piece of a larger Cloud-Native Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC) to enable end-to-end development and management of Cloud-Native applications

## Prerequisites

### Resource group

An existing resource group is needed to identify the collection of resources. It is **highly** recommended not to use the `default` resource group.
Instructions for creating a resource group can be found at [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-rgs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-rgs)

### IBM Cloud API key

An IBM Cloud API key for a user with sufficient authority to provision the SRE tool services into the resource group. API keys are
specific to an account, so a new API key will be needed for each account. Instructions for creating an API key can be 
found at [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey#create_user_key)

### Cluster provisioning

#### Public and private vlans for Classic infrastructure

Virtual local area networks (VLANs) are used by IBM CloudÂ® to isolate broadcast traffic on the public and private 
networks. Public and private vlans are needed to provision a cluster with classic infrastructure. Instructions for creating
a vlan can be found at [https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-manage-classic-vlans#sl_vlan_create](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cli-manage-classic-vlans#sl_vlan_create) 

### (Optional) LogDNA instance

If you want to connect the cluster to an existing LogDNA instance then two pieces of information about the provisioned service are required:

- **logdna_name** - the name of the provisioned LogDNA service
- **logdna_region** - the region where the LogDNA service was provisioned

### (Optional) Sysdig instance

If you want to connect the cluster to an existing Sysdig instance then two pieces of information about the provisioned service are required:

- **sysdig_name** - the name of the provisioned Sysdig service
- **sysdig_region** - the region where the Sysdig service was provisioned

### (Optional) Image Registry configuration

The image registry can be configured in the cluster (and possibly configured within the image registry as well) during the
toolkit install process. The type of image registry will dictate what configuration values are required.

|Variable          |`icr` registry type|`ocp` registry type|`other` registry type|
|------------------|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-------------------:|
|registry_namespace|optional           |no                 |required             |
|registry_host     |no                 |no                 |required             |
|registry_user     |no                 |no                 |required             |
|registry_password |no                 |no                 |required             |
|registry_url      |no                 |no                 |required             |

### (Optional) Source Control configuration

The source control host can also be configured in the cluster. There are two variables required to configure
the source control repository:

- **source_control_type** - the type of source control system (github, gitlog, none)
- **source_control_url** - the url of the soruce control system (root url or git org)
